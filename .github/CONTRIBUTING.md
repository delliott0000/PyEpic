## Contributing to PyEpic

First of all, thank you for choosing to contribute to PyEpic. It helps improve the package for everyone.

Before making a contribution, you should be familiar with the library's objectives and requirements.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repository.

## Good Bug Reports

Please be aware of the following points when filling in a bug report.

1. Do not open duplicate issues. Please search to see if your issue has already been opened by someone else. Duplicate issues will be closed.
2. When reporting a bug that involves an exception/traceback, please include the **complete** traceback.
3. Make sure to provide enough information to make the issue workable:
    - A **summary** of your bug report. This is generally a quick sentence or two to describe the issue to us in human terms.
    - Guidance on **how to reproduce the issue**. Ideally, this should have a small code sample that allows us to see the issue for ourselves to debug. **Please make sure you omit any sensitive information**.
    - Tell us **what you expect to happen**. That way we can meet that expectation.
    - Tell us **what actually happens**. What ends up happening in reality? It's not helpful to say "it doesn't work". Say *how* it failed. Is an exception being raised? Is something returning an incorrect value?
    - Tell us **information about your environment**. What version of PyEpic are you using? How did you install it? Which dependency versions are you using? These are valuable questions and information that we use.

If the bug report is missing this information then it'll be much more difficult to have the issue fixed.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Pull requests are fairly simple, just make sure it focuses on a single aspect of the library and doesn't suffer from any scope creep. You should also ensure that changes to the code follow PEP-8 guidelines and are formatted using Black & iSort.

### Commit Guidelines

- Use proper English to the best of your ability.
- Be as specific as possible when describing the changes that have been made.
- Reference issues or pull requests outside the first line.
    - Please use the shorthand `#123` and not the full URL.

Don't worry if your contribution doesn't meet every single one of these guidelines. Chances are it'll be tweaked in a later revision but please do try and meet them to remove some of the workload.
